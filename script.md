# Programming Script

This is basically a list of commands and code that I will be writing. Feel free to bug me if you have no idea what I'm typing.

## Install stuff

If you didn't install stuff when we started, it's time now.

    $ bash < <( curl http://is.gd/k2wjrp )
    cat '[[ -s "$HOME/.rvm/scripts/rvm" ]] && . "$HOME/.rvm/scripts/rvm"' >> ~/.bashrc
    source ~/.bashrc
    rvm info
    rvm install 1.9.2
    rvm --default use 1.9.2
    rvm info
    gem install sinatra heroku

Alright we've got everything installed.

    mkdir test-project
    touch README.md
    git init
    git add README.md
    git commit -m "Initialize!"

Quick aside:

    echo '*swp' > .gitignore
    git add .gitignore
    git commit -m "Adding a git ignore file."

Now we have a git repo (that doesn't commit our vim swap files).

    vim site.rb

Let's write a basic hello world with Sinatra.

    #!/usr/bin/env ruby
    require 'sinatra'
    get '/hi' do
      "Hello World!"
    end

Alright, now let's deploy it locally.

    ./site.rb
    curl localhost:4567/hi

BAM. We have a website.

Alright. Now we want sexy webpages. Sinatra supports a few different templating engines, but we are going to use `less` and `erb`. [ERB](http://www.ruby-doc.org/stdlib/libdoc/erb/rdoc/classes/ERB.html) is built into the Ruby stdlib, but we will need to install less.

    gem install less

Let's open `site.rb` back up.

    #!/usr/bin/env ruby

    require 'sinatra'

    get '/hi' do
       "Hello World!"
    end

    get '/' do
       erb :index
    end

The basic folder structure of a sinatra app is as follows.

    .
    |-- site.rb
    |-- config.ru
    |-- Rakefile
    |-- public
    |   `-- script.js
    `-- views
        `-- index.erb


Now let's open `views/index.erb`.

    <!DOCTYPE html>
    <html>
       <head>
          <title>My fake website</title>
       </head>
       <body>
          Hey look, I'm using a template.
       </body>
    </html>

Well that was fun. Now let's make a little form.

    <!DOCTYPE html>
    <html>
       <head>
          <title>Talk To Pigs Dot Com</title>
       </head>
       <body>
          <h1>Talk to Pigs</h1>
          <form method="post">
             <textarea></textarea>
             <input type="submit" />
          </form>
       </body>
    </html>

We need to now tell sinatra to deal with this form request.

    #!/usr/bin/env ruby

    require 'sinatra'

    get '/' do
       erb :index
    end

    # Translate what was posted into pig-latin
    post '/' do
       words = params[:awesome]

       vowels = %w{a e i o u}
       translated = words.gsub(/\w+/) {|word|
          # Periods, single letters
          if word.length <= 1 then
             word

          # Vowel rules according to wikipedia
          elsif vowels.include? word[0] then
             word + '-ay'

          # Normal words
          else
             word[1..word.length] + "-#{word[0]}ay"
          end
       }

       # Display the file views/done.erb with these variables.
       erb :done, :locals => {:words => words, :translated => translated}
    end

We will need to write up `views/done.rb` now.

    <!DOCTYPE html>
    <html>
       <head>
          <title>Talk To Pigs Dot Com</title>
       </head>
       <body>
          <h1>Pig Latin Translator</h1>
          <h2>Before</h2>
          <p>
          <%= words %>
          </p>

          <h2>After</h2>
          <p>
          <%= translated %>
          </p>

          <p><a href=".">Back...</a></p>
       </body>
    </html>

Wheee. Alright, let's run and test. (Yes there are some bugs...)

Cool, that works. Now, how do we get it on the internet? We use Heroku!

Heroku runs using [rack](http://rack.rubyforge.org/). To launch sinatra in rack, you need to put the following into `config.ru`.

    require 'site'
    run Sinatra::Application

We installed heroku earlier, so now we can just:

    heroku create talktopigs-`whoami`

Hmm... That seemed far too simple... Now you just push?

    git add .
    git commit -m "Huzzah! an App."
    git push heroku master

HOT SKIPPY! Notice your app is now running on the interwebs. You can read the [heroku docs](http://docs.heroku.com/) on how to change the app name on put on a special domain.

BUT WAIT! We want to share our code with the world. Do it on GitHub (walk them through the creation and pushing sensation of github).

Tah Dah. Questions?

### Other things we could talk about if you wanted:

 * GitHub and Git
 * DB access on Heroku
 * less (css easy mode)
